Unity integeration of Netick.

Netick is a free server-authoritative C#/.NET networking solution for Unity, and in fact for all C#-supporting game engines, it's entirely engine-agnostic. It’s by far the most advanced free networking solution on the market. It’s built with an architecture that’s different from other free solutions. Netick makes building quality and cheat-free multiplayer games easier than ever, by implementing most of the features you need to build an FPS/TPS/Real-Time/Action game.
