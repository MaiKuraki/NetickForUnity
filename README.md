Unity integeration of Netick.

Netick is a free server-authoritative C#/.NET networking solution for Unity, and in fact for all C#-supporting game engines, it's entirely engine-agnostic. It’s by far the most advanced free networking solution on the market. It’s built with an architecture that’s different from other free solutions. Netick makes building quality and cheat-free multiplayer games easier than ever, by implementing most of the features you need to build an FPS/TPS/Real-Time/Action game.


## Features
  * Client-Side Prediction.
  * Full and Partial Delta Snapshots.
  * Snapshot Interpolation.
  * Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs).
  * Physics Prediction
  * Interest Management [Pro].
  * Lag Compensation [Pro].
  * Code Gen.
  * Zero GC.

And many others.

## Technology and Performance

Netick 2 uses an innovative replication algorithm that moves multiplayer game development forward. Not only does it achieve the lowest bandwidth usage ever seen, but it also simplifies networked games by ensuring full networked state update atomicity. Netick 2 uses a novel approach for Delta Snapshots that makes it possible to use Interest Management and Delta Snapshots together, performatively. This has been unheard of in AAA or indie games, due to the difficulty or impracticality of doing that. However, in Netick 2, it just works.

Netick 2 also lets you fully predict anything in the game: network properties, collections, etc. It also lets you easily interpolate anything. This greatly simplifies development for complicated or demanding projects.

Netick 2 aims to solve networking for most types of multiplayer games.
